# Notes
AlexNet is considered the first modern dl networks, it combined many fancy tools and techniques and did a great job at ImageNet.

- dropout: use dropout to prevent overfitting;
- relu: use relu to introduce non-linearity, which can effectively prevent gradient vanishing and save computations;
- use LRN: which now is considered useless and not shown in PyTorch's official implementation;
